In conclusion, media salaries seem largely normally distributed, as most seem to cluster around somewhere between the 70-100k range between the first 10 years.

However, interestingly enough, it seems that there is largely a "cap" on media salaries past 15 years. The data stops correlating, and largely loses its predictive value. This probably represents the "peak" earnings of a specific type of media job (journalist, associate, etc) that can be reached without pushing into management territory.
